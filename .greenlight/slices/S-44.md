# S-44: Parallel Slice Execution

## Why
When multiple slices are ready, users want to run them concurrently via tmux for faster project completion.

## What
Extends RunSlice in internal/cmd/slice_cmd.go with parallel execution via tmux (create session, add windows up to --max, tiled layout, attach) and sequential fallback when tmux is unavailable or --sequential flag is set. Sequential mode re-reads state after each slice to pick up newly ready slices.

## Dependencies
- S-42: Single Slice Command
- S-43: tmux Manager

## Contracts
- C-111: RunSliceParallel
- C-112: RunSliceSequentialFallback
