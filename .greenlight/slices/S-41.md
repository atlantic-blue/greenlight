# S-41: Process Spawner

## Why
Commands that launch Claude need a reliable way to spawn and manage Claude processes.

## What
internal/process package provides SpawnClaude (headless mode with -p flag, configurable flags, caller manages lifecycle) and SpawnInteractive (terminal passthrough, blocks until exit). Both verify claude is in PATH before spawning.

## Dependencies
None

## Contracts
