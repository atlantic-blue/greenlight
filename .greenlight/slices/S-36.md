# S-36: State Reader

## Why
All CLI commands that display project state need to read slice files and the dependency graph. This is the shared state reading layer.

## What
Read all slice frontmatter into structs, read GRAPH.json dependency data, compute which slices are ready (pending + all deps complete), and detect shell vs Claude execution context via $CLAUDE_CODE env var.

## Dependencies
S-35 (Frontmatter Parser)

## Contracts
- C-93: StateReadSlices
- C-94: StateReadGraph
- C-95: StateFindReadySlices
- C-96: StateDetectContext
