# S-40: Roadmap and Changelog Commands

## Why
Users need to view the project roadmap and changelog from the terminal without Claude.

## What
gl roadmap reads and prints .greenlight/ROADMAP.md. gl changelog reads all .md files from .greenlight/summaries/, sorts chronologically, and prints. Both are local, read-only commands.

## Dependencies
S-37 (CLI Dispatch Extension)

## Contracts
- C-101: RunRoadmap
- C-102: RunChangelog
