# S-39: Help Command

## Why
Users need to see available commands and project state from the terminal without Claude.

## What
gl help displays all available commands grouped by category. Detects if inside a greenlight project and appends current state summary (slice count, complete count, ready count). Outside a project, suggests running 'gl init'.

## Dependencies
S-36 (State Reader), S-37 (CLI Dispatch Extension)

## Contracts
- C-100: RunHelp
