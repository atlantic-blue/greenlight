# S-45: Watch Mode

## Why
Users want to fire-and-forget to drain the dependency graph — watch mode auto-launches new slices as slots free up.

## What
gl slice --watch polls every 30s (configurable), detects completed slices, auto-fills empty slots with newly ready slices. Terminates when no in_progress and no ready remain. Enhanced --dry-run shows ready/running/blocked categories and would-launch list.

## Dependencies
- S-44: Parallel Slice Execution

## Contracts
- C-113: RunSliceWatch
- C-114: RunSliceDryRun
