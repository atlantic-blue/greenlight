# S-37: CLI Dispatch Extension

## Why
The existing CLI only handles install, uninstall, check, version, and help. New orchestrator commands need dispatch routing.

## What
Extend cli.Run() switch with new cases: status, slice, init, design, roadmap, changelog. Update printUsage() with categorized commands. Stub handlers until real slices implement them.

## Dependencies
None (wave 23, independent)

## Contracts
- C-97: CLIDispatchExtension
