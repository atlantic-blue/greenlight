# S-38: Status Command

## Why
Users need to see project progress from the terminal without Claude.

## What
gl status reads all slice files, computes progress summary (complete/total, running, ready, blocked, test counts), and displays to stdout. Supports --compact flag for tmux status bar one-liner.

## Dependencies
S-35 (Frontmatter Parser), S-36 (State Reader), S-37 (CLI Dispatch Extension)

## Contracts
- C-98: RunStatus
- C-99: RunStatusCompact

## Decisions
- 20-char ASCII progress bar with # and . characters
- Graceful degradation: missing GRAPH.json shows status without dependency info
- Compact mode returns exit 0 even on error (tmux bar resilience)
- Blocked slices show specific unmet dependency IDs

## Files
- internal/cmd/status.go (modified)
- internal/cmd/status_test.go (new)
