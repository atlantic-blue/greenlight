# S-31: Supporting Command Updates

## Why
Six commands beyond `/gl:slice` read or write slice state: status, pause, resume, ship, add-slice, and quick. All must gain state detection and file-per-slice support to provide accurate state visibility across concurrent sessions.

## What
Update `/gl:status` (read all slice files, compute summary), `/gl:pause` (write to slice file + project-state.json), `/gl:resume` (read from slice files + project-state.json), `/gl:ship` (read all slice files for completeness check), `/gl:add-slice` (create new slice file), `/gl:quick` (update test counts in slice file). All gain state detection and STATE.md regeneration.

## Dependencies
- S-28: Slice State Foundation Documents (schema and format rules)
- S-29: Init Command and State Detection (detection logic, slices/ directory, project-state.json)

## Contracts
- C-83: StatusSliceAggregation
- C-84: SupportingCommandAdaptation

## Decisions
- 2026-02-22: Appended file-per-slice sections to all 6 commands — preserves existing behaviour, adds new format-aware paths
